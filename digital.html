	<p> Worried that an Acoustic Piano may be too much for you? You can consider a Digital Piano instead!
		With the same 88 keys, you get the full range of sounds like the acoustic piano for as little as <b>10%</b> of the price!
		An average digital piano could cost you anywhere from $500 to 2000 dollars. Although it may still be costly,
		it is a much affordable alternative!</p>
	<p> The sounds of the piano are pre-recorded during manufacturing. This differs 
		from its <a href="acoustic.html">acoustic</a> counterpart, which has a hammer mechanism. Nevertheless, because the 
		sounds are pre-recorded, there may be a range of other pre-recorded sounds, such as Cello and Violin!</p>
		
	<p> What's more? Some models allow you to record your own playing for you to analyze your playing more carefully!
		Yet another major difference is the convenience of the digital piano: You do not have to call in a tuner 
		regularly unlike the acoustic ones, and you can even bring the piano around in some instances!</p>
	
	<p> You might then ask: <i>Why would anyone purchase an acoustic piano? </i></p> 
	<p>First, the touch of the digital piano differs from that of the acoustic ones. Therefore, if you intend to pursue piano seriously, I suggest you get an upright piano for yourself (perhaps a 
	second-hand one!) Also, some people really like the sound of an actual piano, as opposed to a recording played from the digital one.</p>
		
	<br>
	
	<p> Here's a more in-depth video which explains how <b>Acoustic</b> and <b><a href="digital.html">Digital</b></a> pianos differ!</p>
