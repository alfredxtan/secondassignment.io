<p> When it comes to learning an instrument, practices are very important. Much like a skill, it takes many hours of practices for you to finally master an instrument.
	In this section, we will go through some of the procedures for you to get started on your practices!</p>
	
	<br> 
	
<div class="container1">
<h3 id="warmups"><strong> Warm-ups </h3></strong>
	<p>Warming up is an essential part of practicing: You have to get your fingers agile before taking on a challenging piece, otherwise you might risk them not being as fluid as you hope.</p>
	<p>Piano players would usually play scales (see "<a href="theories.html">Theories</a>") or variations of them. Here is one of such videos which you can follow:</p>

	<p>If you are up for a challenge, you can refer to the video below, which is a more pleasant sounding but definitely more complex warm-up: </p>

<div class="container2">
<h3><strong>Choosing Your Songs</h3></strong>
	<p>There are songs out there which are more difficult than the others. Furthermore, depending on your personal preference and the purpose of practicing,
		you might also like to choose songs from different genres.</p>
	<p style="font-size:110%">If you are more of a <em>pop-person</em>, you can play simple songs like those shown in this video:
		<iframe width="500" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JcwIOZrqyU">
		</iframe>
	<p style="font-size:110%">If you look to learn <em>classical pieces</em>, but are only just starting out, you may refer to this video instead:
		<iframe width="500" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ag8-i-B2SYo">
		</iframe>
	<p>It is advised that you pick a song that you really like, as it would help motivate you to continue learning the song. Another important skill apart from
		being able to physically play the piano is to read the score, which is why <a href="theories.html">theories</a> are so important!</p>

   <ol style="text-align:left;"> &#128680 We would like to share some tips for practicing the piano before we delve into the practices themselves:
		<li style="padding-top:5px"><b>Set aside at least 20 minutes each day to practice</li></b>
			<p class="li">Practice makes perfect; same goes for learning the piano. Spend sufficient time everyday (20 mins per day is recommended) to work your fingers! </p>
		<li><b>Don't forget to warm up</li></b>
			<p class="li"> It is important for you to warm up your hands for them to move fluidly! You can refer <a href="#warmups">back</a> to learn some of the warm-ups!</p>
		<li><b>Don't try to take on too much</li></b>
			<p class="li"> It takes time and patience to perfect a particular song. Set your goals for each session and try to achieve them, but do not strive to over-achieve!</p>
		<li><b>Practice slowly</li></b>
			<p class="li"> Rushing through a piece means that you might make mistakes. This can get frustrating, and even worse, you might pick up those mistakes. Play each note deliberately and slowly!</p>
		<li><b>Pick a piece that you want to play</li></b>
			<p class="li"> Nothing would motivate you more than picking your favourite piece to practice! You get to both practice while also enjoy the beautiful melody!</p>
